Form 

Files required:
HTML file - 1
CSS file -1
Js file -1

Fields in the form:
1.First name
2.second name
3.email

js- should use oops concept.


Inside the HTML file we create a form accepting 3 field : firstname,lastname and email. 
to show error messages we use <span> tag.


class validation - has two methods 
  validations():method which is used for validating the data
  setter():method which is used to create a object and store all the data in that object using setters.

validations(paramter1,paramteter2) - has two parameters inside of it has if conditions throuch we check the validation and return the value.


addEventListeners
- firstname
-lastname
-email
-submit button

whenever user types in the input field using addeventlistener we call the validation function passing the index and the value as the parameter 
and check whether the value which the user is entering is correct or not if not it will show an error then itself.

when the user clicks the submit button for submitting the form we catch the event using eventlistener and check for 
validation using the same validation function once it passess the validation we redirect it to another page using form action.
